Security Implementation: OWASP Top 10 Vulnerability Fixes
This document provides examples of how common security vulnerabilities, as outlined in the OWASP Top 10, are addressed in the Task Management System.

1. SQL Injection
   Description: SQL Injection flaws occur when an attacker can interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. This allows them to view, modify, or delete data they are not authorized to access.

Vulnerable Code Example (Hypothetical):

// Vulnerable: Using string concatenation to build a SQL query
public User findUserVulnerable(String username) {
// This is a naive example and is not how JPA works, but demonstrates the concept
String sql = "SELECT * FROM user WHERE username = '" + username + "'";
// ... execute query
}

In a real-world scenario, a user could enter ' OR '1'='1 as their username, causing the query to return all users.

Secure Code Example:
The Spring Data JPA framework, which is used in this project, automatically handles SQL injection by using parameterized queries. The UserRepository.findByUsername(String username) method is inherently secure.

// Secure: Spring Data JPA handles this automatically
public Optional<User> findByUsername(String username) {
return userRepository.findByUsername(username);
}

The framework ensures that the username parameter is passed to the database as data, not as executable SQL, preventing any injection attempts.

2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
   Description: XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in its web output without proper validation or sanitization. This allows attackers to execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser, which can hijack user sessions, deface websites, or redirect users.

Vulnerable Code Example (Hypothetical):

// Vulnerable: Directly using user input in a task title without sanitization
public Task createTask(Task task) {
// ...
// String title = task.getTitle(); // Let's say this is sent to a UI
// The UI would render: <div>Task Title: <script>alert('xss')</script></div>
// ...
return taskRepository.save(task);
}

Secure Code Example:
The TaskService.validateTaskInput method prevents XSS by checking for malicious patterns and rejecting the input.

// Secure: Input validation to prevent XSS
public boolean validateTaskInput(Task task) {
// Simple regex to check for script tags
Pattern scriptPattern = Pattern.compile("<script\\b[^>]*>(.*?)</script>", Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE);
if (task.getTitle() != null && scriptPattern.matcher(task.getTitle()).find()) {
return false;
}
// ... other validation
return true;
}

Additionally, for the UI, output encoding is crucial. All user-generated content must be properly encoded before being rendered to the browser to prevent scripts from being executed.

3. Security Headers
   The SecurityConfig.java file includes a basic setup to mitigate several common attacks by configuring HTTP headers:

X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN: Prevents clickjacking attacks by ensuring the page cannot be loaded into a frame from another domain.

Content-Security-Policy (CSP): Mitigates XSS by restricting the sources from which content can be loaded.

X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block: An older, but still useful, header that enables built-in browser XSS protection.
